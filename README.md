# Riemann_zeros_and_the_prime_counting_function
This is a collection of useful scripts that I employed in my End-of-Degree Project (TFG).
I´m doing this 2 years after doing the project so the scripts aren´t fresh in my mind. Additionally, I never initially intended to use these scripts again in the future.

These might be of some use to someone else though as this is very niche.
If you want to understand how the prime counting function is related to the Riemann zeta function,
my TFG explains it very thoroughly with all the mathematical proofs building all the necessary tools for it.
